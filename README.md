## Hi there, I'm Iustin! 👋
I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at Tehnical Univeristy of Cluj-Napoca, passionate about low-level programming and embedded systems.

Languages: C, C++, Java, Python, VHDL. 
Tools: Git, GitHub, VSCode, IntelliJ Idea, Arduino IDE, Meson, Xillinx Vivado  

Projects:

- [**NES Emulator on ESP32**](https://github.com/stolniceanuiustin/ESP32NESEMULATOR) - Work-in-progress NES Emulator emulator written in C++. Running on ESP32 (currently at 20 FPS). Super Mario Bros. 1 and Donkey Kong work flawlessly. TODO: Optimize further, implement other mappers, implement sound.   
- [**Traffic Light Controller on ZYBO**](https://github.com/stolniceanuiustin/Traffic_Light_Network_Controller_ZYBO) - Work-in-progress Traffic Light Controller on ZYBO. SUMO is used for simulation. The PC sends UART data of traffic values and the ZYBO computes the optimal traffic light phase based on an algorithm.
- [**polihack_UrbanFlow**](https://github.com/stolniceanuiustin/polihack_UrbanFlow) - Product prototype developed during a hackathon.
- [**HorseShare**](https://github.com/KOTerra/utcn-HorseShare) - Team project for Software Engineering class. Vue.JS + FastAPI app, designed as a Uber clone. 
- [**CHIP-8 Emulator**](https://github.com/stolniceanuiustin/CHIP8-emulator) - A CHIP-8 emulator written in C with SDL2 for graphics.
- [**Simple MIPS-Pipeline**](https://github.com/stolniceanuiustin/MIPSPipeline) - A MIPS pipeline implementation in VHDL.
