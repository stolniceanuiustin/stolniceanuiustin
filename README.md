Projects:

- [**NES Emulator on ESP32**](https://github.com/stolniceanuiustin/ESP32NESEMULATOR) - Work-in-progress NES Emulator emulator written in C++. Running on ESP32 (currently at 20 FPS). Super Mario Bros. 1 and Donkey Kong work flawlessly. TODO: Optimize further, implement other mappers, implement sound. It is a port of my x86 emulaotr [**Link**](https://github.com/stolniceanuiustin/NESEmulatorCPP)  
- [**Traffic Light Controller on ZYBO**](https://github.com/stolniceanuiustin/Traffic_Light_Network_Controller_ZYBO) - Work-in-progress Traffic Light Controller on ZYBO with a custom UART module.
- [**polihack_UrbanFlow**](https://github.com/stolniceanuiustin/polihack_UrbanFlow) - Product prototype developed during a hackathon. Similar to the project above, but on ESP and more scalable.
- [**HorseShare**](https://github.com/KOTerra/utcn-HorseShare) - Team project for Software Engineering class. Vue.JS + FastAPI app, designed as a Uber clone. 
- [**VGA Controller**](https://github.com/stolniceanuiustin/VGAControllerNexys7) - Simple VGA Controller for Nexys 7.
- [**CHIP-8 Emulator**](https://github.com/stolniceanuiustin/CHIP8-emulator) - A CHIP-8 emulator written in C with SDL2 for graphics.
- [**Simple MIPS-Pipeline**](https://github.com/stolniceanuiustin/MIPSPipeline) - A MIPS pipeline implementation in VHDL.
